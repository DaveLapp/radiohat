# radiohat-folder

This is an early version of the files that need to be installed on a raspberry pi to allow experimentation with the RadioHat version 1.0 hardware.

Use with caution. some of these changes have not been tested.

Note also that some of the files in "docs" are very out of date or incomplete. RadioHat is still a work in progress...
