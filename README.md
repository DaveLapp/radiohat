# radiohat

This is an early version of the folder full of files that need to be installed on a raspberry pi to allow experimentation with the RadioHat version 1.0 hardware.

When downloading and installing it, ensure that it is named "radiohat" and that it is in your home directory, or some of the shell scripts it contains will not work properly.

Use with caution. some of these changes have not been tested.

Note also that some of the files in "docs" are very out of date or incomplete. RadioHat is still very much a work in progress...
